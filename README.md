### How can I help? ###

I am looking to assemble a team of students, no prior experience needed, to learn JS and work together to improve this project. The idea of this project started out quite small and simple (a one-page homework manager for my advisement) and has become much more than one guy can handle alone.

If you are interested in helping, contact me in school or at my [Regis email](mailto:fmatranga18@regis.org) or my [personal email](mailto:thefrankmatranga@gmail.com).
