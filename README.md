### How do I run it myself? ###

You'll need:
* MongoDB
* Python2.7
* NodeJS

Then:

1. ```$ npm run db```
2. ```$ pip2 install trp```
3. Copy ```secrets-example.json``` to ```secrets.json``` with your info
4. ```$ npm run setup```
5. ```$ npm start```
6. Go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

### How can I help? ###

I am looking to assemble a team of students, no prior experience needed, to learn JS and work together to improve this project. The idea of this project started out quite small and simple (a one-page homework manager for my advisement) and has become much more than one guy can handle alone.

If you are interested in helping,

1. Learn JS (if you ask I'll recommend some good beginner resources).
2. Contact me at either my [Regis email](mailto:fmatranga18@regis.org) or my [personal email](mailto:thefrankmatranga@gmail.com).
3. ???
4. Profit
