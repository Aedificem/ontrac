      This was very clunky and not very user-friendly. I's being reworked right now. I've
      already moved most of the functionality it had to the header. The global and
      advisement chats will go here instead along with class info and stuff.
      Please ignore the ugliness of this until it is fixed up. Thank you again for
      being an Alpha Tester for OnTrac.
